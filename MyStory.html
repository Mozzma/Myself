      <h1>Interview with FNU Moazzma</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      <p>Meet FNU Moazzma, a young woman with a passion for education and a powerful voice. Growing up in Pakistan, Moazzma was fortunate to have access to food, schooling, and holidays, thanks to her hardworking father. However, in 2016, she and her family were forced to leave everything behind and start a new life in America. The transition was difficult, as they found themselves homeless and struggling to make ends meet. Despite the challenges, Moazzma was determined to succeed in school and make the most of her opportunities.</p>
      <p>Moazzma credits her success to her dedication to education and her willingness to join school and community clubs. She has held several leadership positions, including being the only girl on the Robotics team, and has used her voice to advocate for change. In her junior year, Moazzma also played a key role in convincing state officials to keep her K-8 school's budget intact, using her creativity and persuasive skills.</p>
      <p>For Moazzma, education and helping others go hand in hand. She finds balance by investing in both, whether it's volunteering at a soup kitchen or fighting for her school's budget. But Moazzma's journey hasn't always been easy. She faced numerous setbacks, including a sudden move to a new country, homelessness, and language barriers, but she persevered and learned valuable lessons about determination and perseverance.</p>
      <p>Today, Moazzma is taking college-level classes and working towards a career in the STEM field, driven by her love of numbers and a desire to make a difference. She is also a tutor, helping elementary and middle school students strengthen their subject comprehension in math, science, and English. In her free time, Moazzma enjoys doing homework and preparing for the next day, always seeking to learn more and expand her knowledge. She is an inspiration to others and a true example of the power of education and determination.</p>
